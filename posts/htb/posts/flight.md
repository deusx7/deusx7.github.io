Difficulty = Hard

Nmap Scan:

We can see the domain name *flight.htb* I added it to my */etc/hosts* file

So there are lots of port but lets start enumerating

Checking smb doesn't allow anonymous listing of shares

Moving over to the web server on port 80 shows this

There's nothing really there

So lets fuzz for subdomains

I'll update my */etc/hosts* file with the new sub domain

Checking it shows this

When I clicked on the home button i get this

Noticing the url we can see that it's including the file *home.html*

We can say that this is vulnerable to local file inclusion lets confirm it

One way we can exploit this is by trying to perform ntlm hash stealing 

Using responder i'll steal the ntlm hash

While on the web server I'll do this

Back on responder I got the hash for user *svc_apache*

I brute forced it using JTR
